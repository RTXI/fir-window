RTXI v1.3 Installing Modules

In the terminal (In Ubuntu, Applications > Accessories > Terminal) :

$ cd MODULE_DIR
$ sudo make install

RTXI v1.3 requires a call to createGUI(var, num_vars) in the module constructor. If you are using an older version of RTXI, you should comment out or delete this line.

This module is already included in RTXI 1.3+ by default. You may edit this code and overwrite the bundled version. You can find the source code for the bundled version in RTXISRC/plugins .
